# Cin7 Picking Logics

## Introduction
Let's assume you would like to extend the Cin7 picking logic. With this project, I am creating an interface which allows to customize the picking process. 

Specifically, in this example, the preference is to pick full totes from location bins. When picking less than a tote from a location bin, than those picks should be separated. A valid use case might to assign those pick orders to different users. 

The project aims to run the picking service securely in the Azure Cloud environment.
